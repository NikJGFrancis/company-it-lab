# Phase 3 — File Server & Shared Folders

# Overview
Created department-based shared folders with strict Linux permissions and Samba for file sharing.

# 1. Shared Folder Structure with Permissions
sudo mkdir -p /company/shared/{hr,engineering,sales,general}
sudo chmod 770 /company/shared/hr
sudo chmod +t /company/shared/hr
ls -la /company/shared/

# 2. Access Control Test

Verified that users can only access their own department folders.
su - alice
ls /company/shared/engineering   # Permission denied
